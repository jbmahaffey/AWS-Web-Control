    <p>
    Welcome to my AWS Controls web application.
    My name is James Mahaffey and I have been in the IT industry for over 15 years.  I have worked in many different roles 
    in the industry from managing a group of engineers at a value added reseller to senior systems engineer for multiple 
    manufactures.  I have worked on multiple automation projects for deploying large scale datacenters to automating network 
    failover.

    This application was built to showcase the power of AWS API's and Python.  The ability to control an AWS account using 
    API's allows DevOps to automate the creation of cloud environments.  This automation allows for admins to scale their 
    cloud environment up or down depending on their needs in a rapid fashion.
